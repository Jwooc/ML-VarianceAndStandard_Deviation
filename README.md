[_`Variance`_]


To get the Variance

1. Find the Mean

2. For each value: find the difference from the Mean

3. For each difference: find the sequare value

4. The Variance is the average number of these squared differences


but, luckily,

NumPy has a method to calculate the Variance.


[_`Standard_Deviation`_]

getting Standard_Deviation is possible, too in this way from Variance.

The formula to find the Standard_Deviation is the root of the Variance.

As a result, the square root of the variance is the Standard_Deviation.


Or the other way around, multiplying the Standard_Deviation by itself is

getting the Variance.


- Variance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Squared: _`σ^2`_
- Standard_Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma: _`σ`_
